This is a simple Ebay Clone project utilizing Ebay's search API. Once opening the AWS link below, you will see a search template where one can specify the name of the product, category to search for, condition of the product and geolocation to search for. Upon pressing the search button, a table showing all the results will be displayed. Each product can be clicked for further details.
